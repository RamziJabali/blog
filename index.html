<p>In an attempt to learn Android development, I decided to do a simple tic-tac-toe game.</p>

<p>First realization:</p>

<p>I couldn't just open my computer and start coding the application, like I would usually be able to when coding a terminal based application. </p>

<p>With that realization came a question:</p>

<p>"How do you want the UI to look like"</p>

<p>I wanted to have a simple grid that the user could click on to mark the board with their player.</p>

<p>Upon answering that question, another came up in protest:</p>

<p>"How will you implement the UI"</p>

<p>With my basic knowledge of Android I listed all the different views I knew.</p>

<p>TextView</p>
<p>ButtonView</p>
<p>EditTextView</p>
<p>ImageView</p>
<p>GridView</p>

With that I made a table
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>View</th>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>TextView</th>
    <th><li>Easy to implement</li></th>
    <th><li>Hard to customize</li>
	<li>Rows and Columns are not programmatically updated</li>
	<li>Looks ugly</li></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ButtonView</th>
    <th><li>Easy to implement</li></th>
    <th><li>Hard to customize</li>
	<li>Rows and Columns are not programmatically updated</li>
	<li>Extremely ugly</li></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>EditTextView</th>
    <th><li>Easy to implement</li></th>
    <th><li>Unneeded feature</li>
	<li>Hard to customize</li>
	<li>Rows and Columns are not programmatically updated</li>
	<li>will Look extremely ugly</li></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ImageView</th>
    <th><li>looks good</li></th>
    <th><li>Hard to make look good</li>
	<li>Hard to customize</li>
	<li>Rows and Columns are not programmatically updated</li></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>GridView</th>
    <th><li>looks good</li>
	<li>Rows/columns programmatically set</li>
	<li>Helps implement UI in neater fashion</li>
	<li>Easy to maintain</li></th>
    <th><li>Hard to make</li></th>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>My priorities for the application:</p>

<ol>
<li>UI</li>
<li>Programmatically set/updated attributes</li>
</ol>

<p>With the priorities in mind the clear winner was the GridView.</p>

<p>So I was going to create this application using the GridView, and the MVVM architecture.</p>

<p>First struggle:</p>

<p>I didn't know how to create a GridView, so as any person would do, I went to YouTube and StackOverFlow for answers.</p>

<p>I was bombarded with the same bad example over and over again, and left with a bit of working code and a bit of knowledge of what I was doing.</p>

<p>My first success came when I used GitHub's search feature to narrow down on similar code.</p>

<p>My second success was from reading articles about GridView, which shed light on what I had to do.</p>
 
<p>I was then able to construct a working piece of code that allowed me to see what I had done.</p>

<p>Combining the learning and searching techniques I found I was able to maximize my outcome and productivity.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the application I wanted to add unit testing so I went with JUnit for testing, but I realized it was not going to be as straightforward as unit testing in a terminal based application.</p>

<p>So with that in mind I had to find a library that would allow me to test my code in isolation without having to make a copy of the code to test separately. </p>

<p>After googling for a few minutes I saw Mockk.io pop up as a great library to use for testing code.</p>

<p>I tinkered with it for an hour or more in an attempt to understand how to use it, but that ended up being a hassle and all I had to do was open their documentation and use their listed example code.</p>

<p>After unit testing was added the application was working and all it needed was a bit of UI and code polishing in highlighted areas.</p>

<p>Once I finished polishing what needed polishing, I shipped it to GitHub marking the end of the program.</p>

<p>Lessons Learned:</p>

<uo>
<li>Search GitHub for example code</li>
<li>Read articles pertaining to the topic at hand</li>
<li>Read the documentation of a library you’re going to use</li>
<li>Spend contiguous hours working on a project to maximize output</li>
<li>Just because it works doesn’t means it’s finished</li>
</uo>

<p>In this project my goal was to make API calls to a weather server, and populate the UI with several weather attributes.</p>

<p>I started this program by first adding the dependencies required for Okhttp and Retrofit.</p>
<p>Secondly I searched up a Youtube tutorial that would teach me the basics of Retrofit and Okhttp</p>

<p>While I was learning the basics I wanted to be able to apply it to to the project I wanted to make, so I looked for a weather API to use in my program</p>

<ol>
<li>Learn Retrofit</li>
<li>Learn Okhttp</li>
<li>Get an API to apply what I learned</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I had written the API endpoint managers, I tried right away to make the API call. Once I ran the application, it crashed. </p>

<p>After a couple of Google searches I realized that I was making the call on the main thread and that was the reason for the application crashing.</p>

<p>I remember here is where I started to get into the discussion of thread management. I didn’t know what a thread in this context even really was, so I decided to Google it and I was bombarded with 100 different answers. Just for sanity sake I boiled it down to, ability to run multiple sequences of code at the same time using different threads(single sequential flow of control within a program).</p>

<p>After that discovery I had to make an adjustment to the code to allow it to run on the background thread as opposed to the main thread. Running the API call in the main thread causes the application to crash because the UI also runs on it. The reason for the application crashing is because the API call might have to wait for a response, which causes the UI to to also wait which inturn causes it to freeze and crash.</p>

<p>The solution to that was using enqueue, which asynchronously sends a request and gets a callback of the result. Which is executed on the background thread! </p>

<p>Perfect, the application was up and running!</p>

<p>After that I changed the architecture to MVVM, added test cases, and added GitHub actions, finally the application was a wrap!</p>



<p>What did I learn</p>
<ol>
<li>Do NOT be intimidated by what you don’t know</li>
<li>Do NOT worry about all the little details</li>
<li>Get the application up and running, then worry about making it better</li>
</ol>

	<p>08/17/21</p>

<p>This project was a combination of everything that I have learned thus far with extra specs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Retrofit</li>
<li>Okhttp</li>
<li>RxJava</li>
<li>Koin Dependency Injections</li>
<li>OkHttp</li>
<li>Picasso</li>
</ol>

<p>This project is a Pokedex application that shows a set number of pokemon at first and allows you to click on a pokemon of your choosing to learn more about that character.</p>

<p>Broken down into two pieces first Pokedex, a set of Pokemon, and Pokemon, a specified Pokemon from the Pokedex page.</p>

<p>It will also allow you to scroll down till you reach the last Pokemon available in the poke.api</p>

<p>The first step that I took was pickout an API that has adequate information about Pokemons</p>

<p>Lucky for me there is a very well documented pokemon API <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">Poke Api</a> made by Paul Hallet that was perfect for this project.</p>

<p>With that in place I first started by creating Koin dependency injections for Retrofit, OkHttp, and GsonConverterFactory so that I can run a quick test to see a sample of the pokedex api.</p>

<p>After I got the network calls working I started to build the first UI component, a screen full of Pokemon characters with their names and pictures.</p>

<p>Todo that I decided to go with the GridView which would allow me to show a good amount of Pokemon on one page.</p>

<p>I was able to implement the GridView without much trouble, and was able to customize the GridView without much trouble either.</p>

<p>Lucky for me I was able to find a different API that contained only images of the poekmons that corresponded with PokeAPI pokemon id numbers!</p>

<p>I didn't know how I would be able to show these images in my application and that's when I discovered Picasso by Square which gave me a seamless experience incorporating the pokemon Images into the Pokedex UI!</p>

<p>I first tried making the two UI elements into fragments as a step up in my coding game, but I had already made one UI element into an activity and the other into a fragment I was conflicted on whether or not to go the all fragment route or the all acitivity route.</p>

<p>Since I had already made alot of progress using Activities as opposed to Fragments, I decided to recreate the fragment into a activity to keep the progress of the application steady.

<p>The next order of business was implementing the next UI element, a dedicated Pokemon page with multiple stats on the Pokemon.</p>

<p>I needed one key piece of information to be passed to the Pokemon page, from the Pokedex page, which was the Pokemon ID.</p>

<p>That gave me a bit of trouble, because I didn't know the proper etiquette of passing infromation between two activites.</p>

<p>After researching and asking people that are knowledgable on the topic I ended up creating a newInstance static function that takes in Context and Pokemon Id integer.</p>

<p>This newInstance function as the name implies returns a new instance of the Pokemon activity that is used to then launch it!</p>

<p>After that was solved all that was left to do was to spit shine the code and make changes were they were needed and wanted.</p>

<p>I ended up upgrading the Pokemon UI by adding horizontal progress bars in correlation to the pokemon stats and fixing text locations</p>

<p>Another neat addition was adding animation to the launch and exit of my Pokemon Activity!</p>

<p>A realized a number of problems while cleaning my code</p> 
<ol>
<li>The pokemon image API was not working and had an incomplete list of the prokemons</li>
<li>I was using the wrong endpoint for my Pokedex and had to make a huge number of calls to populate the Pokedex page</li>
<li>No use cases were created for the Pokdex and Pokemon Page</li>
</ol>

<p>One point of conflict was realizing that I had been using the wrong endpoint and that I was making needless calls left and right inorder to create the Pokedex page, luckily it was a very simple change and didn't end up actually simplifying the application</p>

<p>Replacing the pokemon image API was required a bit of finnese and turned out better than the previous API I was using.</p>

<p>Creating usecases took a big burden of the viewmodel for the Pokedex and Pokemon pages and ended up reducing and making the code a lot prettier!</p>

<p>Take away:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get your app up and running then start cleaning up and adding features to it!</li>
<li>Don't be scared to delete your code in place for better code!</li>
<li>Don't get cold feet, just because you're unsure of your capabilities!</li>
</ol>

<p>Workout Tracker</p>

<ol>
<li>Room Database</li>
<li>RxJava</li>
<li>Caldroid</li>
<li>Koin Dependency Injections</li>
</ol>

<p>This project was done as means to learn database management for a bigger project that I am wanting to do!</p>

<p>My thoughts on what I want the application to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>I want the user to open the app and see dates that they have/haven't worked out in</li>
<li>I want to allow the user to click on a date to mark that they have/haven't worked out</li>
<li>I want a database to record the dates that a user has worked out in</li>
</ul>

<p>My ideas on how I was going to conquer the project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Divide the project into smaller pieces</li>
<li>Do NOT reinvent the wheel, use what others have created to better your project</li>
<li>Decide on a database you want to use and stick with it</li>
<li>Do NOT over commit to a specific idea you have</li>
</ol>

<p>With my ideas all laid out here is how this project went!</p>

<p>I started by using the default CalendarView, and had no success in implementing any of the main features that I needed.</p>

<p>I will admit that I spent an extremely unreasonable amount of time trying to figure out how to add colors to specific dates, which ultimately proved fruitless!</p>

<p>My first learning moment had set on me here, after I had spent three or more hours just trying to make this CalendarView work with no results, I just had to let go of this widget and look for one that fits my needs.</p>

<p>I searched GitHub for a Calendar widget that I can use and found one(<a href="https://github.com/roomorama/Caldroid">Caldroid</a>) that was perfect for my requirements.</p>

<p>I quickly implemented Caldroid into my project and added on click listeners to allow users to show whether or not they had worked out on that clicked date.</p>

<p>It was my first time using Dates in a project so I had to learn how to convert to and from the Long data type</p>

<p>I made this using the MVVM architecture to allow it to read nicely and also because it makes the code easier to write and easier to connect later on.</p>

<p>Once the calendar widget was sorted I shifted my focus to database management and decided to use <a href="https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room">Room</a> after seeing that it was simple to use and had the features that I required for my project.</p>

<p>This marks the end of one of the smaller pieces</p>

<p>I had to learn how to make a database and how to add data to it which was a breath of fresh air!</p>

<p>I first created an entity called "user_workout_schedule" which only had a date in Long and did_user_attend_date in Boolean, very basic.</p>

<p>I then created a Room database, followed by a DAO.</p>

<p>Creating the data access object took a while as I had no idea on how to create the standard operations, but after a couple Google searches and a couple of articles I was good to go.</p>

<p>Next I created a repository for the data base, and with that out of the way all was left was connecting the pieces together and adding final touches!</p>

<p>I decided to add a UseCase to allow for smooth conversion between the entities schema and the app schema. Adding usecases really allowed me to make headway and was an eye opener on how important it is to allow for abstraction.</p>

<p>With a couple of tweaks here and there and a solid code review the application was done!</p>

<p>Take aways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do NOT get too attached to an idea</li>
<li>Do NOT get too attached to specific technologies and be okay swapping them out for better technologies</li>
<li>Cut your project into bite sized pieces to allow for breathing room</li>
</ol>
