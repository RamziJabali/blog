<p>In an attempt to learn Android development, I decided to do a simple tic-tac-toe game.</p>

<p>First realization:</p>

<p>I couldn't just open my computer and start coding the application, like I would usually be able to when coding a terminal based application. </p>

<p>With that realization came a question:</p>

<p>"How do you want the UI to look like"</p>

<p>I wanted to have a simple grid that the user could click on to mark the board with their player.</p>

<p>Upon answering that question, another came up in protest:</p>

<p>"How will you implement the UI"</p>

<p>With my basic knowledge of Android I listed all the different views I knew.</p>

<p>TextView</p>
<p>ButtonView</p>
<p>EditTextView</p>
<p>ImageView</p>
<p>GridView</p>

With that I made a table
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>View</th>
    <th>Pros</th>
    <th>Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>TextView</th>
    <th><li>Easy to implement</li></th>
    <th><li>Hard to customize</li>
	<li>Rows and Columns are not programmatically updated</li>
	<li>Looks ugly</li></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ButtonView</th>
    <th><li>Easy to implement</li></th>
    <th><li>Hard to customize</li>
	<li>Rows and Columns are not programmatically updated</li>
	<li>Extremely ugly</li></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>EditTextView</th>
    <th><li>Easy to implement</li></th>
    <th><li>Unneeded feature</li>
	<li>Hard to customize</li>
	<li>Rows and Columns are not programmatically updated</li>
	<li>will Look extremely ugly</li></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>ImageView</th>
    <th><li>looks good</li></th>
    <th><li>Hard to make look good</li>
	<li>Hard to customize</li>
	<li>Rows and Columns are not programmatically updated</li></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>GridView</th>
    <th><li>looks good</li>
	<li>Rows/columns programmatically set</li>
	<li>Helps implement UI in neater fashion</li>
	<li>Easy to maintain</li></th>
    <th><li>Hard to make</li></th>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>My priorities for the application:</p>

<ol>
<li>UI</li>
<li>Programmatically set/updated attributes</li>
</ol>

<p>With the priorities in mind the clear winner was the GridView.</p>

<p>So I was going to create this application using the GridView, and the MVVM architecture.</p>

<p>First struggle:</p>

<p>I didn't know how to create a GridView, so as any person would do, I went to YouTube and StackOverFlow for answers.</p>

<p>I was bombarded with the same bad example over and over again, and left with a bit of working code and a bit of knowledge of what I was doing.</p>

<p>My first success came when I used GitHub's search feature to narrow down on similar code.</p>

<p>My second success was from reading articles about GridView, which shed light on what I had to do.</p>
 
<p>I was then able to construct a working piece of code that allowed me to see what I had done.</p>

<p>Combining the learning and searching techniques I found I was able to maximize my outcome and productivity.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the application I wanted to add unit testing so I went with JUnit for testing, but I realized it was not going to be as straightforward as unit testing in a terminal based application.</p>

<p>So with that in mind I had to find a library that would allow me to test my code in isolation without having to make a copy of the code to test separately. </p>

<p>After googling for a few minutes I saw Mockk.io pop up as a great library to use for testing code.</p>

<p>I tinkered with it for an hour or more in an attempt to understand how to use it, but that ended up being a hassle and all I had to do was open their documentation and use their example.</p>

<p>After unit testing was added the application was working and all it needed was a bit of UI and code polishing in highlighted areas.</p>

<p>Once I finished polishing what needed polishing, I shipped it to GitHub marking the end of the program.</p>

<p>Lessons Learned:</p>

<uo>
<li>Search GitHub for example code</li>
<li>Read articles pertaining to the topic at hand</li>
<li>Read the documentation of a library you’re going to use</li>
<li>Spend contiguous hours working on a project to maximize output</li>
<li>Just because it works doesn’t means it’s finished</li>
</uo>
